# Grid tables for the local disk reflection model `reflionx`

Four tables are provided for the `reflionx` model. They can be downloaded from: https://github.com/honghui-liu/reflionx_tables/releases/tag/table

1. `reflionx.mod`
    - The input spectrum is a `cutoffpl` with the cutoff energy fixed at 300 keV.
    - The electron density is fixed at 10^15 cm^-3.
